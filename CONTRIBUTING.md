## Submitting Pull Requests

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to RecoEdge](https://github.com/NimbleEdge/Sentinels) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).
Please Squash your commits into one before sending the pull request.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

* Please use the autopep-8 reformat **on the VCS changes** before the final commit.
* Ensure indentation consistency
* Follow Google code style
